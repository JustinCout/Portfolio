              Tollo is a personalized fitness application that assists people
              through their healthy journey. Users can create a profile, input
              their measurements, set goals, create workout plans, set
              reminders, and more. Tollo is designed to help members succeed in
              leading a healthy lifestyle and achieving their fitness goals.
            </p>

            <p>
              This application was developed on a team of four people. Each team
              member is a full stack developer and created 3 data-driven
              features. Aside from that, we each chose areas of focus to fulfill
              a well-rounded application. Justin and Beverly took the lead on
              the front-end and design of the application. Jing and Delan
              focused on the back-end and server-side aspects of the application
              including database structure, accounts, and hosting. We all had
              areas of focus that we took ownership for, however, the project
              was a large collaboration in every aspect.

          <h2>Features and Roles</h2>

          <p>
            I was responsible for designing the application including the logo,
            colours, and mock-ups. On top of that, I created 3 data-driven
            features. These features include reminders, notifications, and the
            about section in the profile view. I took ownership of the profile
            page, as well as I designed the entire application with Beverly.
          </p>
          <img
            src="assets/tollo-profile.png"
            alt="Tollo profile page"
            id="tollo-profile-img"
          />
          <p>
            The reminders feature is located in the profile page and allows a
            user to create, edit, view, and delete reminders. Notifications and
            reminders work together, as when the date and time of a reminder is
            set, it sends the message to the notifications table. I used an ajax
            call to check the notifications table on an interval to see if any
            new notifications were added. When there is a new notification to
            display, it updates the number badge located in the header. A user
            can then check notifications by clicking the icon in the header to
            access a dropdown menu. Last, notifications are deleted once the
            user clicks the clear button.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the profile view, the first tab is the About section. It is
            designed so that when the user fills out information about
            themselves including their name, gender, age, and bio, they can only
            update it afterwards. This prevents the user from creating multiple
            about rows in the database, as when they update this section, it
            will update the only row that has their information by finding the
            foreign key, user ID.

                id="tollo-logo"
              />
              The design process started with wireframes that were initially
              hand-drawn. We then took the structure of the wireframes and
              brought the design to life in Adobe Photoshop. Finally, the
              mock-up was coded with HTML and CSS. The styling of the website is
              a mixture of Bootstrap and custom CSS. Last, the logo was done in
              photoshop, taking a silhouette of a flexing arm into a white
              circular background. The objective of the logo was to match the
              branding of a fitness-based audience, as well as it stands out as
              a universal symbol for strength.

          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            The main challenge we faced in this project was the organization of
            code when multiple people were working on the same file.
            Structurally, we followed MVC (Model View Controller) and
            established the file structure early on to keep everything in order.
            However, order was difficult to maintain in global styling sheets,
            and the notifications controllers because there were at least 2
            contributors in those files. The notifications controller brought
            together objects from both the reminders and goals features, and
            goals was not one of my features.
          </p>
          <p>
            We overcame these challenges by going over the code together and
            communicating. We agreed on a structure that was readable, as well
            as it organized the code in a logical manner. We used comments to
            divide sections and explain exactly what each function was doing. We
            achieved a well organized controller that brought together three
            classes with comments and a naming convention.

          <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
          <p>
            Out of all the projects I have done so far, I learned the most from
            Tollo. In a group project that combines all the aspects of a
            data-driven application, communication is key. This means telling
            your group what you are working on, when you plan on completing the
            MVP, and when you are going to push to the repository. Repository
            communications and maintenance is critical in a group project. For
            instance, if you donâ€™t communicate and comment all of your commits,
            it gets really hectic and you are risking losing work. It is
            important that everyone pushes regularly whenever they reach a small
            milestone, and everyone pulls to ensure they are working on the most
            up to date version of the project. When there is a merge conflict,
            it is important to communicate with your team and ensure you do not
            overwrite another member's work.
